;These represent a new way of reducing spell costs. The new formula for spell cost reduction is:
;1 / (1 + fCostReductionSkillWeight * AV), reduced up to (1 - fMaxSpellCostReduction) * Original Spell Cost.
;In short, this is a much better system for spell reduction when paired with the optional plugin in the page
;and Parapet's excellent Crafting Skills Revamped: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25418

;This is not recommended for Simonrim/Requiem.
;If you are going to be editing fCostReductionSkillWeight, be aware that skills can go into the negatives,
;so if you make the denominator 0, you WILL crash. EG, for fCostReductionSkillWeight = 0.01:
; 0.01 * -100 = -1 => Denominator == 0, therefore crash.
