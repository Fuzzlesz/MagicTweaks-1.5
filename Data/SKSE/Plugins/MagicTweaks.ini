;This mod comes with a premade INI. Naturally, every time the mod updates
;a new version of the INI ships even if nothing changes. Thus, custom
;changes need to be re-applied every update. 

;To go around this, this mod comes with "custom INI" functionality.
;simply copy the INI, rename it to MagicTweaks_custom.ini, and any
;setting you change there will overwrite valid settings in the 
;default INI. 

[Fixes]
;Poisons from traps count as spells and can be absorbed. This fixes that.
bNeverAbsorbPoison = 1

;Self targetting effects have a chance to be absorbed. This fixes that.
;Similar to Engine Fixes' Conjuration Absorb Fix, but more complete.
bNeverAbsorbSelfTargettingEffects = 1

;NPCs can absorb effects that are beneficial to them (healing hands, courage).
;This fixes that.
bNeverAbsorbBeneficialEffects = 1

[Tweaks]
;Effects with a duration do not count down in dialogue if this is set to true.
;HEAVILY recommended.
bExtendEffectsInDialogue = 1

;If 1, applies tweaks to bound weapon effects. Note: Certain mods add non-weapon
;bound effects (bound quivers, armors, etc). These ARE NOT bound weapon effects.
bTweakBoundWeapons = 1
